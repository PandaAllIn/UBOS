**Preparing investor presentation outline**

I'm focusing on producing an investor pitch deck outline for Romanian and EU investors. It’s not about code changes, even though developer notes mention tools and guidelines. I want to create a clear document with bullet points and headers, emphasizing key data like market size, EU grants, and Romania's absorption rate. We need to ensure accuracy up to 2025, citing relevant budgets like the EU Multiannual Financial Framework and NextGenerationEU. Keeping track of everything will be essential!
**Summarizing financial allocations**

I need to update figures for Romania's funding. The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) total is €723.8 billion, originally €672.5 billion, with grants around €338 billion and loans near €385 billion. Romania's NRRP is approximately €29.2 billion, with grants at about €14.24 billion and loans around €14.94 billion. The Cohesion Policy allocation for 2021-2027 is about €31.5 billion. For EU funds absorption rates from 2014-2020, Romania’s rate is close to 95%. It's crucial to present these details accurately while keeping any approximations clear!
**Estimating consulting fees and market potential**

I'm estimating admin that and consulting fees for EU-funded projects range from 1-5 of grant% values. Given the vast budgets for Horizon and Cohesion, the potentially serviceable market could be around €3-5 billion each year. My solution involves creating an AI agent, EUFM, that orchestrates various processes like matching calls, generating proposals, and managing compliance. I’ll also analyze the competitive landscape, considering players like IDOX and CORDIS, while emphasizing the advantages of real-time automation through AI. I need to be careful with disclaimers regarding compliance and data sourcing!
**Defining the business model and traction**

I'm working on outlining a B2B SaaS business model for consultants, which will include a per seat and usage-based fee structure, with optional success fees. There are tiers for solo, boutique, and enterprise customers, plus add-ons like data enrichment and compliance templates. Since we're dealing with a hypothetical scenario, I need to suggest plausible early traction without fabricating data. I can frame commitment as "early pilot commitments" and use placeholders for target metrics while ensuring the presentation remains compelling. Crafting a template with "insert actual numbers" will help!
**Crafting the pitch deck details**

I’m outlining our pitch deck, focusing on market data and traction while being careful not to guess milestones if not provided by the user. We can phrase traction as "pre-seed stage; prototype underway" with placeholders for user input. For financial projections, I’ll include 3-year assumptions without real data. It's important to highlight Romania's potential funding landscape and absorption challenges while discussing the consulting market. I'll format everything with clear headers, bullet points, and concise content, including placeholders in team roles. Let's ensure the document is well-organized and meets the user's needs!

Here’s a concise, investor-ready pitch deck outline tailored to Romanian and EU investors. It emphasizes data-backed market context, EU compliance, and competitive advantages for EUFM (European Union Funds Manager) — an AI agent orchestration system for EU funding consultants.

**Problem**
- Fragmented discovery: Thousands of EU/national calls across portals (Funding & Tenders, CORDIS, national OPs like My2021), with inconsistent eligibilitySMIS/SMIS and changing guidance.
- Manual, slow workflows: Scoping, partner search, budget build, narrative drafting, compliance checks, and portal submissions take 80–200+ hours per proposal.
- Low/late absorption: Romania historically lags EU averages early-cycle; delays and errors in filings, audits, and procurement reduce award rates and disbursement.
- Limited scalability for consultants: Senior experts are bottlenecks; quality varies by team, language, and programme familiarity.
- Compliance risk: GDPR, eIDAS, national procurement (e.g., ANAP/e-licitatie), audit trails and change logs are hard to enforce consistently.

**Solution**
- AI agent orchestration for end-to-end EU funds management: specialized agents for call matching, eligibility reasoning, narrative drafting, budget/compliance, partner matching, KPI design, risk plan, and reporting.
- Dynamic eligibility engine: continuously reconciles call texts, annexes, FAQs, corrigenda; explains “why/why not” eligibility with clause-level references.
- Proposal coilot-p: multilingual drafting aligned to Horizon Europe, Cohesion Policy OPs, LIFE, DIGITAL, Erasmus+; auto-structured sections, Gantt, KPIs, TRLs, ethics, gender, dissemination, budget tables.
- Partner marketplace: entity graph and fit scoring (past awards, TRL, SIC/NACE, geography); NDAs and document exchange built-in.
- Compliance-by-design: GDPR, data residency in EU/RO; eIDAS-compatible signature workflow, ISO 27001-ready controls, immutable audit logs.
- Integrations: Funding & Tenders, CORDIS, TED, national OP portals (incl. Romania’s systems), e-licitatie for procurement alignment; export to official templates.
- Post-award automation: deliverables tracking, timesheets, procurement compliance, beneficiary reporting, risk/issue logs, KPI dashboards.

**Market Opportunity**
- Macro budgets (2021–2027):
  - Cohesion Policy: ~€392B
  - Horizon Europe: ~€95.5B
  - Connecting Europe Facility: ~€33.7B; Digital Europe: ~€7.5B; LIFE: ~€5.4B; Erasmus+: ~€26.2B
- Romania focus:
  - Cohesion Policy allocation: ~€31.5B (2021–2027)
  - RRF (PNRR): ~€29.2B
- Serviceable market for consultants/software:
  - Assumption: 1.5–3% of awarded funds spent on consulting/software enablement.
  - EU-wide relevant annual awards ≥70€–90B → €1.0–2.7B/year SAM for tools + services.
  - Romania annual disbursement potential €8–10B → €120–300M/year local SAM.
