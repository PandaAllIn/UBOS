**Organizing platform tasks**

I need to break down the platform into manageable tasks and create markdown tickets at a specified path. First, I should read the spec file and check for any generated outputs. The tasks will be grouped by epics like the API gateway and workflow engine. It’s important to use tools for this, especially considering developer instructions, which suggest including a preamble before shell commands. Since this involves multiple steps, I’ll create a brief plan using the update_plan tool. I need to run some shell commands
**Executing shell commands**

Next, to list the directory and view the contents of the spec file. This step is important since it will give me an overview of what's available and help me understand the context better. I'll ensure I follow the right sequence here, so I can gather all the necessary information to move forward effectively. Let’s proceed with this plan to keep things organized!

I’m going to inspect the spec and any related outputs, then draft a concise set of epic-grouped markdown tickets and write them to the outputs path.

**Creating actionable tickets**

I have a few key documents: the spec, openapi.yaml, database schema, implementation roadmap, and deployment strategy. I need to create actionable tickets organized by epics like API gateway, and billing system., descriptions, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and so Each ticket should include titles on. I'll group them under monetization-projects/.../outputs/tasks.md. Before I jump in, it makes sense to quickly read through the implementation roadmap and openapi.yaml to gather necessary details for writing these tickets. Let's open those files now!

# Implementation Roadmap (EUFM Enterprise Orchestration)

Time-bound, incremental delivery aligned to multi-tenant SaaS, real-time monitoring, and enterprise security. Suggested tech: TypeScript/Node.js, PostgreSQL(+Timescale), Redis, NATS/Kafka, Kubernetes.

## Phase 0 — Foundations (Week 0–2)
- Architecture baselines: repo structure, CI/CD, envs (dev/staging/prod)
- Core packages: API service, Orchestration service, Adapter interfaces
- Observability scaffolding: OpenTelemetry, structured logging, metrics
- Security baseline: secrets management, KMS envelopes, lint + SAST
- Deliverables: Architectural docs, runbooks, env bootstrap

Acceptance: Services boot locally and in staging; health checks green; CI/CD deploys.

## Phase 1 — Multi-tenant Core (Week 2–5)
- DB schema (tenants, environments, users, RBAC, API keys)
- Tenant scoping middleware (JWT + `X-Tenant-Id`, `X-Env-Id`)
- RBAC enforcement for REST/GraphQL resolvers
- API keys issuance (prefix + hash), rotation, revocation
- Audit logging for authn/z, config changes

**Planning ticket creation**

I’m getting ready to craft tickets that align with the user's requests. The deployment-strategy document could inform tasks related to Kubernetes and other secrets. The user specifically mentioned tickets for the API gateway, multi-provider adapters, workflow engine, billing system, monitoring dashboard, and enterprise security features. I'll ensure each is covered with multiple tickets in a tasks.md file. Before writing, I’ll prep a patch with a clear overview. I’ll follow the specified formatting guidelines closely.
  - Permissions seeded; role templates per plan
  - Route guards enforce RBAC for all security-sensitive endpoints
  - Tests cover deny/allow matrix
- Dependencies: SEC-001, API-002

**Finalizing task completion**

I've created the tasks.md file and now I need to provide a clear final message about the completion and summarize what we've the next steps. I’ll covered, mentioning where the written and tickets are how they align with the outputs and specs. A few concise bullet points will be beneficial, and I could also offer to adjust priorities or discuss JIRA formatting. However, since we didn't touch the code, running a TypeScript compilation check or tests isn't necessary. I'll keep the message brief!
[2025-09-09T07:37:00] codex

Created epic-grouped development tickets.

- File: monetization-projects/orchestration-saas/specs/001-enterprise-orchestration-platform/outputs/tasks.md
- Epics covered: API Gateway, Multi-Provider Adapters, Workflow Engine, Billing System, Monitoring Dashboard, Enterprise Security Features, Shared/Infra, Quality Gates
- Each ticket includes: description, acceptance criteria, dependencies, estimate, priority, and links to spec/openapi/schema/roadmap

Want me to convert these into a CSV/Jira import format or adjust priorities based on your team capacity?
