**Creating a comprehensive guide**

I need to create a thorough guide and project structure in our environment at /Users/panda/Desktop/EUFM with full access. The focus is on developing a EUFM Figma MCP Usage Guide. This will include details on using Figma MCP for investor pitch decks, automated UI/UX design for SaaS, and marketing material design automation, along with templates for business presentations. I'll also outline a workflow for design-to-code conversion. Plus, we should add necessary documentation and sample scripts to integrate MCP with Figma!
**Building documentation structure**

I’m a create docs planning to folder with a README or GUIDE. My idea is to include example TypeScript code for MCP tool handlers that interact with the Figma API via MCP. This would involve a "Figma MCP" that wraps the Figma API for agent use. I want to focus on a usage guide alongside the project structure. I'll need to inspect the repo for what’s already there to help create or align sample code. Let’s make a list of files!

I’m going to scan the repository to understand its current structure, then add a docs folder with a comprehensive Figma MCP guide and example TypeScript scaffolding aligned with your multi-agent system.

**Creating Figma MCP Guide**

I’m noticing we don’t have specific Figma right documentation now, but there’s a setup document for Stripe's MCP servers. I think I could create a new document for Figma MCP usage and the example project structure. The user asked for a comprehensive guide and project structure with details, so I need to be thorough. Including example scaffolding and templates in TypeScript seems useful. I’ll also ensure that we don’t have any broken imports or executed code when adding those files under the appropriate directories.

**Planning project documentation**

Given the constraints, I’ll outline what needs to be done for the documentation. I'll add a detailed guide for using Figma for investor deck creation, automated UI/UX generation, and marketing materials. Practical examples will help illustrate how to implement various features. 

I also want to include a project structure document showcasing the folder layout for the design system. Sample TypeScript scaffolding is important too, with functions for creating design elements while ensuring readability and following guidelines about comments. We'll think about testing and include a folder for that.
**Considering test integration**

I’m thinking about whether to add tests, though it might feel excessive. The guidelines mention testing changes before completing the project, but in this environment, we can check TypeScript compilation instead. Since there's no Jest config, I worry the tests folder might not be set up properly. 

I’ll ensure the code compiles without fully integrating it. I'll also check the package.json for any type missing packages, like the MCP SDK, since they could be necessary for the new files.

**Checking SDK and TypeScript setup**

I’m realizing that without the MCP SDK dependency, importing it will cause type check failures. To stay safe and ensure the build isn't broken, it makes sense to add the code under documentation instead of in the main source folder. Alternatively, I could implement TypeScript in a different directory that's not compiled, like in examples/. But I should double-check the tsconfig as it probably only includes the src directory. Time to verify that!

**Planning documentation structure**

I’m realizing that only the src folder is included in the build, which could lead to breaks if files additional are added there that depend on missing dependencies. To keep existing functionality intact, I shouldn’t place code under src. Instead, I’ll create documentation in docs/figma for comprehensive a guide and example project structure as the user requested. Also, adding a non-compiling example in examples/figma-mcp with TypeScript will work since the configuration limits compilation to src.
**Implementing documentation updates**

I’m planning not to modify package.json to prevent any changes to functionality. Instead, I’ll add entries in .env.example for settings like FIGMA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN, FIGMA_TEAM_ID, and FIGMA_FILE_ID, which seems safe. I’m also thinking about creating a step-by-step "design-to-code" workflow document. It’s important to include content that focuses on the market, like generating deck slides for market projections. Additionally, I'll provide prompts for MCP-driven agents and a mapping of design tokens to code. I'll list steps for design-to-code conversion as well.
