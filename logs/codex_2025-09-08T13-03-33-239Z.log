**Planning META-RESEARCH document**

I need to create a comprehensive META-RESEARCH document that synthesizes different sources into a business plan. The working directory is on my desktop, and I have to ensure I follow the coding guidelines even though this task is mostly about creating a business document. I should check for existing files like AGENTS.md in the repo and possibly update the README. Ultimately, I'll add a new document, maybe named docs/META-RESEARCH.md, while being concise in my messaging.
**Exploring the repo structure**

I think I should start by exploring the repository to understand its structure and check for any AGENTS.md file that may contain documentation instructions. I’ll use the shell function to list the files, providing a brief preamble as per the tool guidelines. My plan is to run commands like `ls -la` to see the file listing, `rg -n "AGENTS.md"` to locate that specific file, and perhaps some TypeScript code with `rg -n ""`.

I’ll scan the repo for structure and any AGENTS.md or docs conventions, then add a comprehensive META-RESEARCH plan file.

**Creating a research document**

I’m diving into the docs we have, like the EUFM SaaS Monetization Strategy, to find revenue models. The user wants a meta-research document that brings together multiple sources into a unified business plan, including analyses from various platforms and previous strategies.

While I need to ensure I don’t fabricate facts, I can synthesize information we have, although some sources like Twitter discussions aren’t available in the repository. I’ll focus on what’s known and documented.
**Organizing research insights**

I need to phrase the insights as synthesized ideas rather than specific details, while still leaving room for placeholders if necessary. The user is looking for comprehensive information, so I want to ensure I cover all the structured sections they've requested.

These include market validation, competitive positioning, a go-to-market strategy with a 90-day execution timeline, revenue model optimization, partnership strategies, risk mitigation, success metrics, and a step-by-step implementation roadmap. I’ll also ensure this document aligns with the Project Context: EUFM and references existing monetization strategies. I should check existing documents for useful information.

# EUFM (European Union Funds Manager) — SaaS Monetization Strategy for EU Funding Consultants

Version: 1.0 • Owner: Growth/Monetization • Last updated: {{today}}

This is an executable business plan for EUFM — an AI Agent Orchestration System focused on EU funding consultants. It is structured to plug into a product-led, automation-first operating model with minimal manual intervention. Each section includes automation workflows, KPIs, and data schemas to operationalize the strategy.

Note: All automation steps refer to generally available SaaS tools and can be orchestrated by n8n/Zapier, GitHub Actions, or internal Node/TypeScript workers. Replace tool placeholders with actual stack choices during implementation.

**Synthesizing plans**

I'm noticing there's a lot to explore in this document, and I want to synthesize it effectively. I should also check out the ORADEA_90_DAY_MASTER_PLAN.md because it might have valuable insights. Incorporating that 90-day timeline will be beneficial for my understanding and execution. I want to make sure I'm pulling everything together cohesively, so let's get started on examining those documents closely for the best takeaways!

# Oradea Business Development Master Plan (90 Days)

Last Updated: {{LAST_UPDATED}}

Purpose: Unify Portal Oradea, EUFM, and GeoDataCenter strategies into a single, execution-ready 90-day plan with daily operations, partnership roadmap, client funnel, and revenue projections. Designed as a living document with automated reporting and progress tracking.

---

## Strategic Integration
- Pillars: Portal Oradea (market platform), EUFM (EU funds acquisition engine), GeoDataCenter (flagship geothermal AI datacenter).
- Flywheel: Portal Oradea attracts local market participants → generates leads for EUFM advisory and data products → credibility and public-private partnerships accelerate GeoDataCenter funding → GeoDataCenter elevates brand, drives premium partners and sponsorship on Portal Oradea.
- Core Objectives (90 days):
  - Launch and monetize Portal Oradea (MRR > €6k by Day 90).
  - Build EUFM pipeline (15+ active projects, 3+ submissions, 1+ award pending).
  - Advance GeoDataCenter: consortium formation, pre-feasibility, and 2+ submissions (Horizon/CET).

**Creating an actionable business plan**

I need to synthesize everything into a unified actionable plan. The documents contain lots of crucial details, so I should produce a single structured document with the requested sections. The “previous Codex SaaS strategy” could refer to existing files like EUFM_SaaS_Monetization_Strategy.md. It’s important to include a 90-day execution timeline and adapt from the ORADEA_90_DAY_MASTER_PLAN. I can also compile the "risk mitigation plan" and establish "success metrics and KPIs" from various sources. Lastly, I’ll add a roadmap with concrete actions.
**Developing a structured META-RESEARCH document**

I’m focusing on crafting the content carefully, referencing existing documents generically. It's fine to include competitor names from the monetization doc, like EUcalls and TED. I’ll need to ensure clarity by using section headers in Title Case and bullet points. The final message will include a summary and mention the created file, but I won’t dump the content since the user can access it in the CLI. I should add a detailed 90-day execution timeline, outlining tasks per week or day. the META
